brlaser: Brother laser printer driver
=====================================

brlaser is an open-source CUPS driver designed specifically for Brother monochrome laser printers and multi-function devices.

While most Brother printers can use standard printer languages like PCL or PostScript, some models do not. If you have a monochrome Brother laser printer (or multi-function device) and the other open-source drivers are not working, brlaser might be able to help. Additionally, there have been reports of some non-Brother printers working with this driver.

The software is released under the GNU General Public License, which grants the right to freely use, distribute, and modify the program without requiring any permission from the software's author or any fees.

**Note**:
Some operating systems may not immediately update the driver they provide. This can cause supported printers to be missing from your system, or fixed bugs/issues to still be present on your installation.


Installation
------------

Most Linux and BSD operating systems already ship this driver. This is the case for at least Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux, Gentoo, NixOS and Guix.

Look for a package named ``printer-driver-brlaser`` or ``brother-brlaser``.

You'll also need ``Ghostscript``, in case that's not installed automatically.

Once brlaser is installed, you can add your printer using the usual CUPS interface.


Testing Other Printers
----------------------

If your printer is not officially supported, please select either the ``Owl-Maintain/brlaser Test Driver`` or the ``Owl-Maintain/brlaser Test Driver Duplex`` to test if the driver works with your printer.

If you are able to successfully print, please submit a compatibility report by opening a new issue on GitHub and selecting "**Report Compatible Printer**".

Next, with your printer powered on, connect it to your computer via _USB_ or obtain your printer's _IP address_.

**For USB-connected printers:**
- Run the following command:

   ``sudo lpinfo --include-schemes usb -l -v``

- Example of output:
   ```
   Device: uri = usb://Brother/HL-2270DW%20series?serial=000000000000
           class = direct
           info = Brother HL-2270DW series
           make-and-model = Brother HL-2270DW series
           device-id = MFG:Brother;CMD:PJL,PCL,PCLXL;MDL:HL-2270DW series;CLS:PRINTER;CID:Brother Laser Type1;
           location =
   ```

**For network printers:**
- Run the following command:

   ``/usr/lib/cups/backend/snmp IP_ADDRESS_HERE``

- Example of output:
   ```
   INFO: Using default SNMP Community public
   network lpd://HL-2270DW-LAN/BINARY_P1 "Brother HL-2270DW series" "Brother HL-2270DW series" "MFG:Brother;CMD:PJL,PCL,PCLXL;MDL:HL-2270DW series;CLS:PRINTER;CID:Brother Laser Type1;" ""
   ```

Please provide the output of the command so that we can add the proper entry for your specific printer model in the driver.


Building from source
--------------------

To compile brlaser from source, you will need to have CMake and the CUPS development packages (such as cups-devel, libcups2-dev, or libcupsimage2-dev) installed on your system.

You can get the source code by cloning the Git repository or downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/Owl-Maintain/brlaser/releases/latest).

To compile and install the driver, use the following commands:

````
cmake .
make
sudo make install
````

Note that you may need to restart CUPS before the driver is loaded and ready to use.
